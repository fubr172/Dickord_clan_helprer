## Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/). Ensure that you check the box to add Python to your PATH during installation.

---

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Open your command line interface (CLI):

- On **Windows**, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
- On **macOS** or **Linux**, use the Terminal.

Navigate to your project directory:

Use the `cd` command to change to the directory where you want to create your bot:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project/directory
```

---

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

Run the following command to create a new virtual environment. You can name it `venv` or any name you prefer:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
## Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
On macOS or Linux:

```bash

source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## Step 3: Install Required Libraries

With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary libraries using `pip`. The main libraries required for your bot are `discord.py` and `aiogram`. You can also install `python-dotenv` for managing environment variables if needed.

```bash
pip install discord.py aiogram python-dotenv
```

---

## Step 4: Set Up Your Bot

1. Create a new Python file (e.g., `bot.py`) in your project directory and copy the bot code into this file.

2. **Configure Tokens and IDs:**
   - Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual **Discord** and **Telegram** bot tokens, as well as any channel or role IDs that are specific to your server.

3. **Run Your Bot:**
   After setting everything up, run your bot with:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```
---

## Step 5: Managing Your Environment

When you finish working on your project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply running:

```bash
deactivate
```
This setup allows you to isolate your project's dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects. You can also create a `requirements.txt` file by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```


# Discord and Telegram Integration Bot

The provided code is a Discord bot that also integrates with Telegram. It manages various functionalities related to user roles, vacation requests, and voice channel management. Below is a detailed overview of the constants used in the code and their explanations.

## Constants and Their Meanings

- **AFK_CHANNEL_NAME:** `"AFK"`  
  The name of the channel designated for users who are away from their keyboards.

- **CREATE_CHANNEL_NAME:** `"Создать канал"`  
  The name of the channel where users can create new voice channels.

- **CHECKED_ROLES:** `[]`  
  A list of roles that are monitored for certain actions or commands.

- **INSTRUCTOR_ROLE_NAME:** `[]`  
  A placeholder for roles designated for instructors or similar positions.

- **LLOWED_ROLES:** `[]`

## Usage Overview

### 1. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed in your environment, such as:
- `discord.py`
- `aiogram`

You can install these libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install discord.py aiogram
```

---

## 2. Set Up Tokens

Replace the placeholders in the bot's code with your actual bot tokens:

- **DISCORD_TOKEN:** Your Discord bot token.  
- **TELEGRAM_TOKEN:** Your Telegram bot token.

---

## 3. Configure Roles and Channels

Ensure that all the specified roles and channels exist on your Discord server:

### Roles:
- `"Гость сообщества"` (Community Guest)  
- `"Предупрежден"` (Warned)  
- `"Отпуск"` (Vacation)  

### Channels:
- A channel for creating new voice channels (e.g., `"Создать канал"`).  
- An AFK channel (e.g., `"AFK"`).  

Additionally, update any IDs for roles and channels in the bot's code.

---

## 4. Run the Bot

Run the script in your Python environment:

```bash
python bot.py
```

---

## 5. Interact with Commands

Use the bot's commands to manage roles and user requests. Examples:

- **Request Vacation:** `/отпуск` (requires providing a reason and end date).
- **Warn Users:** `/warn` (requires necessary permissions based on your role).
